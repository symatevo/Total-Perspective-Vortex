Brain computer interface with machine learning based on electoencephalographic (EEG) data.

This repository showcases a project where I processed cerebral activity data using machine learning algorithms. The data originated from a motor imagery experiment, where participants were instructed to either physically perform or mentally visualize hand or foot movements in response to specific symbols displayed on a screen. The recorded results are cerebral signals, accompanied by labels indicating the moments when subjects were tasked with a specific movement.

Key aspects of the project include:

- **Data Processing**: Handled EEG data, primarily using Python due to its compatibility with specialized libraries like MNE for EEG data processing.
- **Machine Learning Implementation**: Applied scikit-learn, a robust Python library, for machine learning purposes.
- **Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm**: Successfully implemented an algorithm for dimensionality reduction, enhancing data processing before classification stages.
- **Integration with scikit-learn**: Seamlessly integrated the dimensionality reduction algorithm within scikit-learn, enabling the use of its tools for advanced classification and validation of model accuracy.
